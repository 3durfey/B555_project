6,1,Just diagnosed late November . Stage I and with good prognosis . I had my lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy on Friday -LRB- Dec 4 -RRB- . The initial prelims with the node were good and I am just waiting on the path reports now . I am amazed at how much this consumes my thoughts even though I feel positive about my diagnoses . I am so thankful for a place like this to come and express my thoughts and feelings . I am 38 and also have extremely bad endometriosis and since my cancer is hormone + I can no longer take my LoEstrin which was keeping the endo somewhat in check . I have only been off the hormones about two weeks and am already experiencing pelvic pain . Now I am having to consider a hysterectomy and am really scared and do n't know what to do . I have no children and do n't really think I want to . I really want to do what is best for me but it is so hard to know . Anyone else been in the same boat with the endometriosis ?,boat,else been in the same boat with the endometriosis ?,1

6,0,"danismom - the wait is the absolute worst part . I also did n't discuss bc with anyone for a long time . The lump was found 12/26 and did n't tell anyone until just before my appointment with the surgeon on 2 / 25 , the day before my biopsy . Then I only told my dh . And I waited for what seemed like forever . I had surgery on 3/24 and started chemo on 4/24 . The months , I still feel was too long . I just wanted to get it over . STill feel that way . I thought I was good with all of the treatments until the week before I started chemo . I was a nervous wreck . I snapped at everyone , especially people trying to be nice , I could n't concentrate , I could n't sleep . When I went for the first tx , I felt calm . I had no problems during the infusion , and my nurse is great . I met with her when I had the first onc . appointment and she went over side effects , meds I take , etc. . The day of the first infusion , she explained everything in detail - what I was getting , what it was for , what to expect . I felt calm . Dh and I played cards most of the time . He beat for a change - I still blame it on the benadryl . I was there the first time for about 5 hours , with the infusion lasting about 4 . I did n't have many side effects , but I had read what others and said , so I tried to stay ahead of them - I began with a stool softener that night , etc. . I was more at ease with the second , but still somewhat nervous , as I expect I will be each time . I told the nurse that I had no problems the first time and I would like to go slow again . They usually do the taxotere a bit faster the second time . She said sure . Today is day 4 and so far only a bit of bone pain last night -LRB- could be taxotere or neulasta -RRB- and that 's it . Remember that you can be in control of part of this - take your meds , drink lots , rest , do something you enjoy that puts this in another part of your mind . That 's the hard part .

On September 14 , 2007 , breast cancer patients and it 's community loss a valiant fighter against breast cancer . Martin D. Abeloff , M.D. , 65 , died of leukemia . He was Chief Oncologist and Director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Johns Hopkins University . Dr. Abeloff 's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when he was twelve . His witness of her disfiguring radical mastectomy results , and lengthy , toxic treatments awakened in him a passion towards breast cancer research , resulting in groundbreakng work in breast cancer screening as a key prevention tool . Dr. Abeloff was known by his patient 's for an extraordinary kind bedside manner , non-rushed approach , which allayed many a breast cancer patient fears . He frequently providing them with his phone number for future questions or concerns . At a Hopkins event this year he was noted for saying , `` You simply ca n't treat cancer without paying attention to the psychological and social aspects of the disease '' . Early in his career , he noted the stigma of a cancer diagnosis , saying `` many patient 's felt guilty , as if it was their fault they had cancer . This blaming-the-patient mindset was common at the time , and added to the stigma of the disease '' . He credited activism and advocacy on the part of patient groups with helping to reign in such thinking . Dr. Abeloff , whose contributions to oncology are too many to list , was instrumental in facilitating Hopkin 's largest single donor gift , a $ 150 million dollar donation from Sidney Kimmel . During his 15 years of leadership at the Center , he went on to double the Kimmel Center 's number of faculty members , oversee a sixfold increase in research funding , and raise it 's ranking consistently to one of the nation 's top three cancer centers . A much beloved , dedicated cancer researcher and clinician died this week of cancer . We thank him and his family for his fervent dedication to the cause , and keep them in our thoughts during this time of mourning .

I also apply the cream -LRB- Emla or generic -RRB- an hour before tx ; apply liberally & cover with saran wrap . I had a port inserted during my lumpectomy , & I 'm so glad that I did . They draw the bloodwork thru it on tx day , plus give my the pre-tx meds & then the tx 's thru it . The pre-meds they gave me on tx day were Decadron -LRB- steroid -RRB- , Aloxi -LRB- anti-nausea -RRB- , & Ativan -LRB- anti-nausea + anti-anxiety -RRB- . -LRB- Next tx , I 'm going to try w/o the Ativan ; I was exceptionally sleepy the entire day last time , & my onc said I could try w/o it or w/half dose . -RRB- On days 2 & 3 , I 'm to take Emend -LRB- 80mg -RRB- & Decadron -LRB- 8mg -RRB- in the morning ; day 4 continue with 8mg of Decadron in the morning . -LRB- I 'm going to try splittin the 4th day 's dose of Decadron into 1/2 dose on day 4 & 1/2 dose on day 5 , to lessen the post-steroid crash that I had this time , with my onc 's ok . -RRB- I also have prescriptions for Ativan as well as Compazine for use throughout the cycle , as needed - either one or the other as often as every 6 hrs . Either Ativan or Compazine may be taken together with -LRB- or overlapping -RRB- the Emend & Decadron , but the Ativan & Compazine should not be taken together or have their doses overlap . My onc told me to get Miralax , & they suggested I take a dose on tx day as a precaution -LRB- to avoid constipation -RRB- . I did n't take one that day because I had no problems in that area , let 's just say . I did take a dose of it the morning of days 2 & 3 , but have n't needed to take it since , as nature has been moving things along . -LRB- I also have Immodium on hand but have n't needed that either . -RRB- The Compazine does n't seem to be terribly constipating , at least not at the level I was taking it . I took Zofran to combat nausea from the pain meds I had after surgery , & that -LRB- plus the pain meds -RRB- was much more constipating for me . But each person is different . -LRB- A friend of mine who 's an onc nurse actually recommends using stool softeners rather than laxatives , but I went with my onc 's recommendation . Either w/b ok , though . -RRB- I took one Ativan before bed on tx day -LRB- post-tx , just to make sure I slept -RRB- , & have n't taken any since . I took one Compazine each morning on days 2 thru 6 , did n't take any more at any other time on those days , & have n't taken any since - and I 'm now on day 10 . The other thing I 'm doing , at the suggestion of alot of posters on the boards here , plus on the advice of a friend who 's an onc nurse , is taking a Pepcid Complete each morning . -LRB- You can take up to 2 of those every 24 hrs . -RRB- Yesterday I forgot to take it , had some indigestion , but nothing horrible , then remembered the Pepcid . I 've been eating whatever I feel like , whenever I feel like it - most of the time the same kinds of foods that I 'd been eating pre-chemo . A few days -LRB- for me , days 5 & 6 -RRB- I had less of an appetite & ate lighter , easier foods . Chicken soup is great , also crackers or toast , & noodle-based dishes without too much sauce or spices . I 've got 8 containers -LRB- at least a pint each -RRB- of home-cooked chicken soup in the freezer now , courtesy of a very good friend of mine . General advice re : meals - Eat smaller portions , more frequently . It 's often easier to get through a small meal or a snack , not only physically by psychologically . And once you start having more successful eating endeavors , it 'll get even easier . One general bit of advice : When people offer to help , LET THEM ! Different people can help in different ways & at different times . My soup-cooker friend happens to be a good cook & is used to cooking in large quantities , plus she 's my closest friend , so I had no trouble asking her to do this . I have other cooking-offers on hold -LRB- for when I 'll need them -RRB- , & have been spreading out the rides I ask for among several people .

The pre-meds they gave me on tx day were Decadron -LRB- steroid -RRB- , Aloxi -LRB- anti-nausea -RRB- , & Ativan -LRB- anti-nausea + anti-anxiety -RRB- . -LRB- Next tx , I 'm going to try w/o the Ativan ; I was exceptionally sleepy the entire day last time , & my onc said I could try w/o it or w/half dose . -RRB- On days 2 & 3 , I 'm to take Emend -LRB- 80mg -RRB- & Decadron -LRB- 8mg -RRB- in the morning ; day 4 continue with 8mg of Decadron in the morning . -LRB- I 'm going to try splittin the 4th day 's dose of Decadron into 1/2 dose on day 4 & 1/2 dose on day 5 , to lessen the post-steroid crash that I had this time , with my onc 's ok . -RRB- I also have prescriptions for Ativan as well as Compazine for use throughout the cycle , as needed - either one or the other as often as every 6 hrs . Either Ativan or Compazine may be taken together with -LRB- or overlapping -RRB- the Emend & Decadron , but the Ativan & Compazine should not be taken together or have their doses overlap . My onc told me to get Miralax , & they suggested I take a dose on tx day as a precaution -LRB- to avoid constipation -RRB- . I did n't take one that day because I had no problems in that area , let 's just say . I did take a dose of it the morning of days 2 & 3 , but have n't needed to take it since , as nature has been moving things along . -LRB- I also have Immodium on hand but have n't needed that either . -RRB- The Compazine does n't seem to be terribly constipating , at least not at the level I was taking it . I took Zofran to combat nausea from the pain meds I had after surgery , & that -LRB- plus the pain meds -RRB- was much more constipating for me . But each person is different . -LRB- A friend of mine who 's an onc nurse actually recommends using stool softeners rather than laxatives , but I went with my onc 's recommendation . Either w/b ok , though . -RRB- I took one Ativan before bed on tx day -LRB- post-tx , just to make sure I slept -RRB- , & have n't taken any since . I took one Compazine each morning on days 2 thru 6 , did n't take any more at any other time on those days , & have n't taken any since - and I 'm now on day 10 . The other thing I 'm doing , at the suggestion of alot of posters on the boards here , plus on the advice of a friend who 's an onc nurse , is taking a Pepcid Complete each morning . -LRB- You can take up to 2 of those every 24 hrs . -RRB- Yesterday I forgot to take it , had some indigestion , but nothing horrible , then remembered the Pepcid . I 've been eating whatever I feel like , whenever I feel like it - most of the time the same kinds of foods that I 'd been eating pre-chemo . A few days -LRB- for me , days 5 & 6 -RRB- I had less of an appetite & ate lighter , easier foods . Chicken soup is great , also crackers or toast , & noodle-based dishes without too much sauce or spices . I 've got 8 containers -LRB- at least a pint each -RRB- of home-cooked chicken soup in the freezer now , courtesy of a very good friend of mine . General advice re : meals - Eat smaller portions , more frequently . It 's often easier to get through a small meal or a snack , not only physically by psychologically . And once you start having more successful eating endeavors , it 'll get even easier . One general bit of advice : When people offer to help , LET THEM ! Different people can help in different ways & at different times . My soup-cooker friend happens to be a good cook & is used to cooking in large quantities , plus she 's my closest friend , so I had no trouble asking her to do this . I have other cooking-offers on hold -LRB- for when I 'll need them -RRB- , & have been spreading out the rides I ask for among several people . It really does make people feel good to help , & you 'll feel better , too ! Hope things go well for you ! ",0

I made the switch right away but I was 49 and chemo had put me in chemopause so I had not had a period for over 6 months and my estrogen levels were postmenopausal . I agree with Tender that you need to eat . Shortly after treatment I consulted with a natural health nutritionist because I knew that I needed to build back up my immune system .

I now drink an organic why protein shake every morning -LRB- made from cows not treated with growth hormones -RRB- and organic eggs . I was surprised that she told me it was okay to eat eggs everyday and did n't realize how healthy they are .

Ya ' have to get the ones there cause they go the fastest and turn the tightest . The ones in Walmart-do not compare !!! And , having never used one , I put on my most pitiful face and crawled in to the cart in HT and just WENT FOR IT . I have not had such fun in a long time !! Mostly ` tripping ' on people -LRB- I know I am a bad cancer person and lightening will strike me soon -RRB- but people could not do enough to help me OR , to get out of the way .

Think about the time you will have to spend on the road and if it will be worth the trip . The type of treatment you have afterwards will also play a role in your decision , ie . chemo , radiation , or hormonal therapy . The surgeon will lay out for you a course of treatment and then you will have to decide where to go from there . Many factors go into it . Just remember , make the decision based on what is right for you and that whatever decision you make it IS the right one for you based on what you know , and your personal history .

0,1,"I had two positive nodes of 12 . I was told originally if I had a mastectomy that I could avoid rads depending on LN involvement . I had the mastectomy and then they verdict was in on the 2 positive nodes . I asked my breast surgeon , oncologist and the other oncologist I consulted with -LRB- the head of oncology for a large cancer center -RRB- and they all said that while you `` could '' radiate with 2 nodes , that standard is usually 3 or more . All these things would depend on tumor sizes , placement , etc. . I was willing to do the radiation if necessary , but it was n't recommended for me by any of the three doctors . I hope and pray I am not sorry years down the road , but since all three said there was n't a lot of evidence that it would decrease my odds ... I went with their opinion .

4,0,"A friend of mine was telling what a brave girl I am . I am not . It 's all smoke and mirrors . I got a precsription for citalopram -LRB- I do n't know the brand name -RRB- . I think it might be helping a little . I keep feeling cinches of fear in my stomach , though . I was kind of hoping I 'd take the pill and then just sit there for hours with my mouth hanging open . It is hope that more productive than trying to generate positivity all the time . That is so true . It 's the loss or lessening of hope that is so depressing . Chumfry , thank you for the mantra . Fear is so crippling . I wish I could have had that surgically removed too . Yesterday , I thought that maybe if I just face death by staring into the gaping abyss instead of trying to change my thoughts that I could make it go away . So , I took a little ride up to my plot near my younger brother 's grave . We have 4 plots for my family - a gift from my father after my brother died of cancer - you know , in case of a family tragedy -LRB- my dad is a dark realist -RRB- . I looked at it as my final resting place , not just my brother 's . I went in the office there and got a brochure for headstones so I could design my headstone -LRB- how about `` Told you I was sick ? '' or `` Well , that was fun ... '' -RRB- . Anyway , I thought if I just went down that road it would help . Then , I cried all the way home and called the onc to get a pill . BF2009 , so sorry about your diagnosis . I called inyourshoes the other day , yesterday a Triple Neg 4 year survivor called . She had a positive lymph node like I had . Inyourshoes matches you w / a counselor with a similar diagnosis . It did give me more hope than I had before the call , just having come back home from the cemetary . She 's going to email me some new research info on Triple Neg . I can see if I 'm technically proficient enough to share it with you guys . ",ride,", I took a little ride up to my plot near",0
2,1,"Hi sister , my advice is to tell your little one that you have cancer . Then tell him you and dad are worried , but you KNOW you will be just fine . Tell him do n't be scared if he sees you crying or without hair , or whatever , that as a family , you will get through this and be fine . Tell him everyone has to help , he needs to feed the dog , help fold the clothes , take out the trash , that together , you are strong . The reason for using the word , is he will hear it . And he needs to hear it first from you , not from eavesdropping on a phone conversation . Those little ears are antennas . Some of the younger women have told their children 's teachers . Not that they want them to say much , just so they are aware of what is going on at home . Now to happier thoughts . 90 % of us will be just fine . I am 9 years post treatment and have many friends that are further past treatment than that . Chances are excellent you will make a full recovery . My favorite story was several years ago a woman had the `` family talk '' , and after she and her husband finished , they told the kids when things were normal again , they would all go to Disneyland , their littlest one ran out on the front porch and shouted to all the neighbors , `` My mom has cancer and we are going to Disneyland ! '' . They just broke up laughing . My mom 's best friend just died at 94 , 44 years post double mastectomy . And my mom died of a stroke 12 years ago . We all felt so sorry for Frances . I met a lady at the dog park who also has had breast cancer and it was in 1985 . She said she sometimes forgets which side it was on . I do n't mean to make light of this disease . It is hard , long and at times , nasty . But most of us will survive and live to be old ladies . Gentle hugs , Shirlann ",light,do n't mean to make light of this disease . It,1
2,1,"You 're right , Donna it does . I 'm sorry first that there is one rib of concern , and now an additional two . Thank goodness you and your Mom went to your oncologist . What is it with the `` wait and see '' approach anyway ? I know of few people with cancer and pain and + bone scan findings , with your history , who could wait and see for 3 more months . Since the first bone did n't `` heal '' from the fracture diagnosis , and now there are two additional ribs which seem involved in a process , it 's time for action . So you 'll get your CT scan to delineate the area better . It may well be that your oncologist and orthopedist will suggest a biopsy from the most accessible bone . This would be most helpful to rule out any breast cancer , and if it is breast cancer , to recheck your tumor markers . It 's very important to recheck the ER and the HER marker if tissue is obtained , as some 20 % or more of ER+HER - breast cancers will change to ER + HER + , maybe even VEGF + breast cancer . Knowing this will allow therapy specified to your current state if it turns out as recurrent breast cancer . I 'm so sorry you 're going through this , and my personal wish is this is all benign . I could n't see that you had radiation therapy , yet you have a rad oncologist so it appears you did . Bone fractures do occur in bones previously radiated , but with breast cancer that 's hormone positive , we need to ensure that by proper testing . Especially in light of the AI 's and Fulvestrant -LRB- Falsodex -RRB- which offer non-chemotherapy control . Do keep in mind the HER issue , as that has been shown in multiple studies and allows treatment with anti HER drugs . Please keep us posted . I am glad your Mom was there with you , and that you have each other . All the best , djd , Tender ",light,proper testing . Especially in light of the AI 's and,1

2,1,"My radiation onc told me today that I have 9 more regular treatments ... 9 MORE ! Woohoo ... I like the sound of less than 10 . 9 more will make 26 in total . She also said my skin was holding up better than most and if it keeps doing this well , we will do 5 boosts -LRB- sheesh , I actually ca n't remember if she said 5 or 8 boosts ... I got so excited at the sound of 9 more regular treatments -RRB- . I wonder if the curcumin has something to do with my skin reacting so much better than she expected . I am seriously pink and sore , a little peeling in the supraclavicular area but the pigment is generally so high in that area from the years in California . I have also started using a cooling pad from Lindiskin . It feels so nice but I have no idea if it actually does anything other than cool the area . We talked about my implant today and she 's confident there wo n't be much , if any , significant damage . We 'll assess 2-3 weeks after completion of Tx .

4,0,"Sheila , thanks for bumping this thread . Everyone seemed to have disappeared ... Yes , it is a major thrill to put tops on over my head . It 's those little things that bring joy ! As you say , each type of surgery has different requirements as far as type of bra/no bra to wear . As one who has expanders , I 've discovered the body shaping tops without a shelf , which are supportive like a sports bra , but thinner and minus the bulky seams . I prefer the tank style for certain dresses and shirts . However , I do n't know what these -LRB- almost girdle-like -RRB- garments are supposed to fit like , but I am usually a size 4 , and I am wearing a size large tank and it still has lots of support -LRB- and this was with no fill at all -RRB- . I ca n't imagine who 's wearing the smaller sizes -LRB- or even why -RRB- , unless it 's to create a smooth silhouette under a slinky dress . Finally found a front zip bra that I like that 's comfy , too , but that took a special trip to a mastectomy shop . It 's a whole wardrobe adjustment period , esp . with the recent change from fairly cool to warm weather , but I do n't want to go crazy and spend money on stuff that I wo n't be able to wear later . It 's a tough stage , but being able to put things over-the-head increases choices big time . I 've made the rounds at Target and K-Mart for a few pieces of cheaper short-term clothes , and Kohl 's and Boscov 's for undergarments . I started physical therapy last week , went twice . She said I was doing very well , so I 'm off the paranoia wagon about being way behind range-of-motion-wise . I 've been trying to walk a few times a week , and find this goes a long way for lifting my spirits . The rainy weather had put a slight damper on things for a few days , but now it 's just beautiful outside . I 've been hanging out over on the Breast Reconstruction thread since I 've started my fills . Yesterday was my second one , and , same as the first , left me feeling quite uncomfortable . Less pain than the first time , but I prepared a little better -- hot shower , valium , and pain pill at the ready for the car ride if I sensed a start in pain . I did start to feel it , so I popped the pain med and was able to stay ahead of the pain curve . Today I feel slightly swollen , and I have a PT appt. , so we 'll see how that goes . I think we 'll have to go easy this session . Sheila , it really is hard to not do things we 're not allowed to do . Every once in a while I find myself picking up something a little heavy , and think , oh carp ! , put that thing down . I hope your PS gives you good news about your flap and that it is healing nicely . Your path is so much tougher than mine , girl , and I have such admiration and respect for your determination . I feel like such a weenie complaining about my much smaller issues . Hugs , Tina ",ride,the ready for the car ride if I sensed a start,0
2,1,"Ulla , I 'm so happy for you ! I had no idea you were so close to finishing up your chemo ! Do you have to do radiation or hormonal meds or anything else ? Anyway , congratulations a few days early ! TeasKaren , the taxotere really affected my sense of taste and not in the ways i expected . For me , most sweet things , even fruit , tasted awful . I usually drink Pepsi One , and that did n't taste good either , but ginger ale continued to taste OK . Some veggies were OK , others not . Potatoes in general were n't good . Basically , the only things that tasted OK most of the time were cheese , crackers and pickles . Not exactly a healthy diet , but since it was for a limited time , I decided not to worry about it . The good news is that my taste is pretty much back to normal now since I 've finished the treatments , so do n't worry , it 's not permanent . On a general note , now that I 'm over 3 weeks past my last TC treatment , the watery eyes seem to be clearing up , slowly but surely . Also , I 'm gradually starting to get more energy back . I think this whole experience has given me some permanent changes though . I 've found that the forced down times that I took turned out to be very precious to me -LRB- and to my cat , I must add ! -RRB- , so I plan to continue some of them on a regular basis even as I feel better .

0,1,"Good Morning Jewels , Again , I am amazed at all that 's been posted since yesterday ... KathyL and SheShe48-Shocking that a pediatrics office-an office that deals with medicine - can be so discompassionate to one of its own nurses . SheShe48-same to you ... a BC Survivor fired you ? I do n't think that 's even legal ... firing someone on the spot for disclosing they were diagnosed with cancer . -LRB- Not that I 'm advocating filing a wrongful termination suit - who would want to work for someone like that anyway -RRB- . I feel for you both on the tightening finances . I am sooooo lucky to work in my school district . We have a Catestrophic Leave bank that we donate to each year . I applied to be granted enough leave to get me through the end of the school year . I am awarded 20 days at a time , and have been told there is enough to get me to the end of the year plus plenty of days for others in our district who may need it . Once that is done , if I need more time , my disability insurance will kick in at 75 % of my pay . Kathy , I hear you about all the germs and being on your feet all day long . As a teacher , I 'm in the same boat . Parents send their sick ones to school all the time , and I often do n't get to sit all day long - except during my 36 minute lunch , if I take lunch as I often give up lunch to assist kids who need help - having 5 periods and over 130 + students in and out of the classroom . I had to take the rest of the year off ... and it killed me ... I miss my kids so much ... but I had to put my well-being first . D1-Not only is FUBC totally appropriate ... but FUSE -LRB- F. . U. . . Side . . Effects -RRB- too !!!! You crack me up ... even when you 're feeling like the Vikings snapped you the ball and let the other team trample all over you . I often say to the TV ... like it can hear me ... when pharmaceutical companies advertise their wares ... `` How can you put on that smile and do whatever it is you 're doing with all those SE 's ? '' Notice the SE 's are stated quickly in the background like we wo n't notice . Who can function at all , let alone have sex , with a four hour erection , loss of hearing , and eyesight ? And those SE 's for the CMF chemotini sound dreadful ... of course , not everyone experiences these SE 's ... and they have to be disclosed ... but that 's scary shit ... oops , sorry ... it just slipped out ... must be an SE of BC . Vettegal-I hear you on being impatient ... and agree with all the advice/support already given . I had nodes removed on the left side at the same time as my bilat , and healing is slow , but it does get better little by little and day by day . Hang in there ... oh , you ca n't do that yet -LRB- neither can I now that I mentioned it -RRB- ... ummm ... Stiff upper lip dahling ... you 've got the right stuff !!! Love the T-Shirt idea . My DH was in landscaping for over 15 years before he blew his back out . After three surgeries ending in fusion , he had to give it up . He 's now an energy analyst at a consulting firm working to get alternative energy plants built-solar , wind , biofuel , geothermal , and hydrogen . Carol - A Tugboater and a Truckdriver ? That 's great !!!! My father is working with a group to restore an old WWII tugboat from Pearl Harbor . He was in Hawaii when it was bombed-he was 5 - and his father was a civil engineer hired by the govt to do things like work on the Panama Canal and stuff . Anyway , my dad feels his father may have been on this tug as he toured the damage and worked on a plan to clear away all the wreckage and repair docks and the like . My mother , who passed away at 58 of Pancreatic Cancer , was a wonderfully funny lady . She often stated that when she retired she wanted to be a poet truckdriver . Hee Hee . Sorry to hear your mom passed of melonoma . Anyway , I 'm with you on making 2008 the year I show the world what this gal is made of ... let 's kick butt this year !!!!! Sharon-Thanks for the info on Neupogen and Nuelasta . I know I 'm supposed to get a shot of something the next day after chemo ... but ca n't recall the name of it . Still have n't heard from my oncologists office ... I 'm thinking they took today off and will do the same tomorrow . Welcome Julie K and Chris . You 've found a great group here . Julie , I am 99 % positive that I 'll be getting a hysterectomy and have my ovaries removed , which is apparently not included in a hysterectomy -LRB- uterus only , I believe -RRB- in order to reduce my likelihood of ovarian cancer . My dad had breast cancer and prostate cancer -LRB- still living -RRB- , and my mother pancreatic cancer -LRB- passed at 58 -RRB- , and all of those cancers are tied to the BRCA2 gene ... so Dad 's taken the BRCA test as of last week-my insurance wo n't cover it because we do n't have enough cancer in the family line ... go figure - If he 's positive , then insurance has to cover my test ... but more importantly , my twin will have no problems getting her test approved . I already did a bilateral mastectomy-which is one choice my oncologist would have strongly suggested had the test results been in hand prior to surgery ... and I 'm glad I did have a bilat ... the right breast did have precancerous cells roaming around . Now , the test will determine if I have all my female plumbing removed , since my cancer is ERPR + . Sounds like your family history is full of this dreaded disease , too . I 'm sorry your family has had to go down this road . Has your sister regretted her decision to remove her breasts and female plumbing ? My twin is a bit unnerved by this whole thing ... to be expected . I think I 've gotten everyone ... if not ... know I 'm thinking about you and wishing you nothing but dreamfilled nights , energy filled days , and clear headed minds :--RRB- By the way , Charlie Wilson 's War , was FABULOUS !!!! It 's amazing what this man did ... and how we find ourselves in the same position again ... doing the same thing we 've always done only this time without a man like Charlie on the team . When will our gov ' t learn from its mistakes ? I read the Kite Runner , YuYuBear , and hear the movie is really good ... but I loved the book so much and do n't want to spoil what I imagined in my head ... and heard the movie gives too much away too soon . I 'll have to wait and see if I can bring myself to go see it . I 'm a little weird when it comes to my characters in what I read ... I literally have to grieve the end of a book ...

6,1,"hi fellow cruisers , I hope this boat does n't make me sea sick like I was on Uncle Sam 's Navy Wives cruise many years ago ! I am 51 years old and I start chemo Feb 15th ... my husband shaved his head to support me and gave his hair to Locks of Love . I got my long hair cut the very next day to a very short spiked cut but it was n't quite long enough for Locks of Love . I actually like it now I 'm getting used to it . I will be taking Emend then a cocktail of Adriamycin and Cytoxan 4 doses 3 weeks apart then radiation treatments then Tamoxifin for 5 years . I had a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy in November in my left breast and he found I had stage 0 in a lobal area non invasive cancer .7 cm . Got a second opinion on treatments and changed to a female surgeon . She ordered an MRI for both breasts and found a suspicious spot in my right breast with it and an ultrasound . The spot was n't in any of my mamo 's . She did a needle biopsy and it was invasive ductal cancer 1.5 cm . I already had a lumpectomy and sentinal node checked for spread about 2 weeks ago . The node came back clean and I had clear margins with the invasive cancer . Now chemo is next to help half my chance of reaccuring breast cancer .

Today , however in my my post-op visit , I learned that in the surrounding tissue of the the lump they removed -LRB- 1.5 cm/2 .5 cm -RRB- , they discovered a node and tested it . The location of the node was n't common . Well , the node tested positive for suspicious cell activity , and now I am scheduled to have an MRI done . So , now I 'm freaking out because it seems like most people have the MRI before their surgeries , and I 'm having it afterwards . Has this happened to anyone here ... and if so , what rollercoaster ride can I look forward to ? Before the discovery of the uncommon node , my treatment looked like radiation only , but now it is pretty much decided that I will have to undergo chemo as well .

They ca n't figure out what is wrong with her and I fear the worse . They did a scan and I assume did not find anything or at least that is what my sister is saying and they now want to do an emergency colonoscopy while she is in the hospital . I know that breast cancer does not normally spread to the colon but does spread to the liver ; however , her symptoms do not necessarily indicate spread to the liver and I assume the scans do not show liver involvement either . Is it possible that she has a new primary tumor which is actually colon cancer . I was reading that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are at an increased risk for colon cancer .

Is that true , or as some of you have said they should come out in ten to fifteen yrs . ?? are they really a good option ?

0,1,"Nala : I was diagnosed with LCIS in January after a biopsy for calcifications -LRB- I had previously had biopsies for calcifications and removed a fibroadnoma -- two years ago when I knew something was wrong since having a problem in both breasts , what were the odds that something was n't wrong ?? -RRB- . Anyway two years ago , everything was benign , but this time they found LCIS . I was told by my breast surgeon that they would need to do another biopsy to reconfirm the diagnosis -LRB- which was fine with me -RRB- and to make sure that 's all that was there . Before surgery I had to have the MRI which showed another fibroadnoma this time close to the site where the LCIS was found , so I asked the surgeon to take that out while in there . I was also referred to a breast wellness center at Duke University and told my options : careful monitoring -LRB- testing every 6 months with mammos and MRIs and breast exams -RRB- , clinical trials -LRB- things like random biopsies -RRB- , or masectomies -LRB- I was told 30 years ago that would have been my only option -RRB- . After some research and soul searching , I decided I was going to do the masectomies . I did not want this to take over my life and would rather beat cancer before it had a shot . At least this way I would n't have to do chemo or anything . If only ... anyway , long story short , after the next biopsy they found invasive lobular carcinoma in the sample with the fibroadnoma . The pathologist could n't believe what he/she 'd found -- the surgeon never saw it . So , I 'm looking at it as a blessing .

0,1,"Hi Cheri and tid . I was away for just over three weeks and got back this morning . Hope you got the information you needed to help manage post op . The Am Cancer Society has lots of great ideas and I hope you connected . This was a long time and I 'm sure lots of things have happened in your families . My experience has been if the docs think things are looking bad , they wo n't say much one way or the other . tid . I was very fortunate and did n't have to do chemo so I ca n't tell you what that was like . There are other threads on this site that have a lot of information and support . You will find no doc can guarantee anything . They can tell you percentages and sometimes what her chances are but every person responds uniquely so it 's impossible to tell ahead of time how she will respond . Mostly this is educated guessing which is why you want a well educated doc and why the more you know the better decision you all can make . What did your Mom decide to do ? If your Mom does n't like and does n't trust this doc , call somebody else although I do n't think any doc can give her what she wants because there are no certainties . The bottom line is if your Mom is ready to let nature take it 's course without fighting back , then all you and the medical system can do is help her through it by accepting that as her decision . That is really hard to do . Watching her go is harder still . It sounds like your Mom was quickly going from bad to worse and staying on top of her medical condition was tricky . Cheri : How did your MIL do with the surgery ? How are you managing with her complaints ? There is no winning when no matter what you do , it 's the wrong thing . For sure , she has plenty to complain about . The lymph node dissection from my armpit was the worst part for me and still is swollen . The radioactive injection was to help locate the sentinel node and the surgeon may also have injected some blue dye . The more nodes the surgeon takes out the harder it is post-op and also increases the risk of lymphedema down the road . Getting her to keep using her arm post-op and not lifting any weights until the doc gives his Ok is important . She needs to do the stretching exercises every day until she has regained normal range of motion and then continue to do them to maintain it . I started doing them in the shower when I was all warmed up . I found a good book about this in the library at my hospital and photocopied the exercises . I started massaging the scars as soon as I could tolerate touching myself and that has helped . I also did a lot of stroking the surface of the skin when the nerves started regrowing which caused a lot of burning pain . Some women experience itching at this time . I still use a little pillow under my armpit and another to keep the seatbelt off my chest when driving . It decreases the vibrations and I lost only 8 nodes . Also I use an ace wrap occasionally very lightly applied.There is nothing easy about any of this . My MIL grew up in an orpanage , too . She had some strange ways of doing things that drove her kids nuts but she and I had a lot in common and I loved her and miss her . She 's been gone 4 years from heart disease . Are you finally over that sinus infection and bronchitis ? There was a bug like that going around that took nearly a month to clear . Please do what you can to take care of yourself , too .

0,1,Having just started a new avenue and an unexpected path in my life I now find my self doing a lot of thinking and research . Given two options I am choosing the mastectomy road . My surgery is two days away . Knowing that this is something that must and will be done is a hard one to swollow . However I have one life and keeping my chin up and and knowing I have a good doctor and the love of my family will get me through this . With researching the net I think today which is the day after the bomb was dropped in our laps has helped me better understand what to expect . The not knowing and waiting for the test results was a sure killer on my mind . But now the word is in and I am as ready as I can to jump into the next phase . I am constantly keeping in mind I am not the first nor will be the last going through this . And knowing I am not alone in the long list of survivors of bc . So with that I wait for the big day and move on with my head high knowing I will be added to the list of us who are survivors .,road,I am choosing the mastectomy road . My surgery is two,1

0,1,"I have to add my two cents here . I 'm not a stage IV , but I very well may be somewhere down the road -LRB- or river -RRB- . I do watch the active threads and read/post on a variety of different topics . I do n't lurk and do n't hang out here to be morbid or disrepectful . I come here to offer my support , to get information , and to learn life lessons that sometimes metsters know best . I 'm awed and inspired by the courage , grace , and strength I see here and I can only hope to have some of those if/when I get mets . At the same time I know stage IVs have their own set of issues , but I 'm thankful we can all share experiences and learn from others at different stages and situations than our own . I 'd hate to be limited to posting and reading from only people with my exact situation . I am afraid and I 'm wishing and hoping for the best for all of us , whether the `` best '' is cure , NED , pain relief , or peace at the end . I 'm thankful and hopeful for those taking part in research and clinical trials and I truly hope it 's not offensive or insensitive when I post . I love Pitanga 's boat analogy above , and I feel that I 'm in a boat too , just at a different point in the river . I try not to be offended by non-breast cancer friends or earlier-stage people who ask me questions or try to offer advice or say ignorant , uninformed , or just plain rude things . I try hard to take things in the spirit they were intended , and hope you all do too . Best of luck to us all ! ",road,may be somewhere down the road -LRB- or river -RRB- .,1

It is written by a doctor who had a brain tumor twice . After the recurrence , he started researching why his body was allowing/encouraging cancer to grow .

I am in 2 minds about this and I am hoping you ladies can shed some light on it all !! As you might know I have been on the rollercoaster from hell with all of this liver stuff .

No new scans have been done since 6 months ago so its not as though new info has come to hand its like they have just `` decided '' . People have said to me that it is great news -LRB- which it is obviously ! -RRB- although the cloud of uncertainty this `` diagnosis '' has come under is just a bit much for me .

5,1,"Wow , we certainly are a chatty group . D1/OLE and CarolC - Thank you for the compliment on my poetic musings . D1 - Lump ... in Little Frankenboob ? Could it be scar tissue ? Getting it checked out is obviously the right thing ... but question ? Did you have a PET scan or Breast MRI ? If I did n't have those , my surgeon stated they never would have known about the other two tumors I had . My mammo caught only one ... and the ultrasound found it no problem ... but when I asked that the Dr. do my underarm the ultrasound scan did n't catch the tumor under my arm because it did n't know exactly where to locate it , since it did n't show up on my initial mammo . The PET showed the other two ... on at 7:30 and one in the axillary . The breast MRI confirmed the original tumor and the one at 7:30 , but could n't see the one under the arm because it could n't see under my arms the way they positioned me . The surgeon stated that without those two tests , I would have had a lumpectomy . She felt the underarm tumor as soon as she knew where to locate it , but she had to press in pretty far to feel it . So , just want to make sure you were clear that your surgeon can only go by what info they are given ... not that a second opinion is n't always a good option ... just wanted to give the surgeon the benefit of the doubt . Hope your daughter has a good game tonight . Carol - You rock ... I 'll check out the website , then PM my order . I agree with D1/OLE that we need to include shipping and handling fees , so sending extra is a good idea . Sorry you 're feeling under the weather ... hope you are back in good form for Thursday . Vettegal-Glad to hear that you 're reconsidering your work schedule . I 'm just over a month out from surgery and still am shocked at how tired and sore my arms get . Where I had nodes removed took until about now to be able to lift that arm enough to really clean and shave ... not that you 'll be shaving with an inicision yet , but deodorant on either side of it should be OK . I agree about the washcloth and antibacterial soap helping to get any crusties taken care of ... gently . Sorry to hear that you too are suffering from a cold or flu . Take care of yourself . Welcome Deb3Girls and Jenn 51 - Carol as noted is not thrilled you had to join us , but happy to have some company on the Herceptin train . This is a wonderful group ... you 'll get so much out of it . CathyCA - Does n't it feel great to finally have a plan ? Not that you still wo n't have anxiety moments , but this has to be a big relief to at least have a direction . OK , now my news . Hope Deb did as well as I 've seemed to do so far . Well , I made everyone smile with my Supergirl Cape and martini glass . The nurses filled my glass 6 times -LRB- keeping hydrated is good ... get that chemical mix out of the system as soon as possible -RRB- while I was there , and other commented on my glass and how they wanted a chemotini too . HeeHee . I took about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get through my chemical mixture , so not too bad .

So far ... no SEs to report , though I do n't think they 'll kick in until day 3 if they are going to this round .

4,1,"I was first diagnosed with DCIS in 1999 on the right . I had a mastectomy with reconstruction , no radiation or chemo . Last summer I started having leg pain that I thought was due to exercise . In August I had horrible back spasms and rib pain . I went to the doctor and they took a chest xray where they missed a compression fracture on the film . An way in December I finally had an MRI that showed metastatic disease - a biopsy confirmed it as metastatic disease from the orignial breast cancer -LRB- it was estrogen positive -RRB- . A bone scan showed involvement in the right trocantar as well . am currently on Femara and Zometa . I had to have a rod in my femur and pins to my trochanter -LRB- hip -RRB- . It actually relived the pain and made me more mobile . I have been at this only a month but I see progress every day . I will need surgery to stabilize the T9 fracture but I am hoping I can wait a while and control discomfort with PT . To top off my news I have new primary DCIS on the left and will have a mastectomy with bil reconstruction sometime in the next few months . If you look through the boards you will find that bone only mets is more of a chronic condition . Even if you get other involvement the tumors can shrink and go away . We all want to see NED on our chart -LRB- no evidence of disease -RRB- There is one women who has lived in Stage IV for 17 years .

2,1,"My father was DX with breast canncer 8 years ago . Even though we have no other family history of breast cancer in my family I wanted to be proactive as it is rare for men to have breast cancer . Had my baseline mammo when I was 37 and was normal and was told not to come back till I turned 40 . I turned 40 early this year and went for my second mammo in March 2010 . I received a call back for additional pictures of the Rt breast . Second set of films showed microcalcifications -LRB- 80 % chance of being nothing -RRB- and a subsequent BX showed -LRB- I was in the crappy 20 % -RRB- 8 cm of DCIS in the Rt breast . Scary but 100 % treatable and not life threatening . Had a lumpectomy in April 2010 , and my world took a turn for the worst . Pathology showed 0.4 mm of invasive grade 2 , ER/PR + , HER - cancer with angiolymphatic invasion was reported present on path . Had genetic testing and was BRCA 1 normal BRCA 2 was `` suspected deleterious '' , which meant although not 100 % positive it should be treated as positive . In light of this I opted for a double mastecomy in early June just to be on the safe side and the pathology from this surgery showed to have no additional new invasive cancer since the April lumpectomy and the nodes were clean and negative . Had OncoDX test done and result was 21 , which put me in the low end of the intermediate group -LRB- gray zone -RRB- . Radiation was ruled out since double MX took care of the margins . Primary Oncologist is recommeding 4 cycles of T/C due to the angiolymphatic invasion found on the path report in April . She said if that had not been present she would not recommend chemo as the tumor was so small . However , got 2nd opinon from a Oncologist at Stanford , and they said they could recommend chemo but would not push -LRB- as my primary onoclogist seems to be doing -RRB- and they seem to be making this determination based upon tumor size even though angiolymphatic invasion was noted . Stanford also suggested Tamoxifan & Zoladex might be a good way for me to go instead of chemo , but my primary oncologist never suggested this . But of course Stanford said there is no right or wrong choice and it is ultimately my decision . That is what I am having a problem with . I dont have any children and was hoping to try this year -LRB- hence the check-up at my b-day -RRB- when all this was discovered . A fertility DR stated I have a 100 % chance of going into early menopause if I do chemo , which is of course a major concern for me . If I already had kids the decision of chemo would already have been made . However , the reality is I dont and would still like to . So now what do I do . Tamoxifan is a given as both Oncology Drs seem to agree that the majority of reduction of reoccurance -LRB- 7 % -RRB- will be from the hormone therapy . Meanwhile chemo would only offer and additional 3 % . I would be interested in knowing if any women are in a similar situation as mine . I really and truely do not know how to decide . It seems if I do what my primary onocolgist wants I will have to give up my dream of a child that is biologically mine , but if I dont do chemo and distant reoccurance occurs down the line how do I reconcile that I didnt do all that I could when I had the chance . Is anyone going through this as well ? ",light,treated as positive . In light of this I opted for,1

It did n't dawn on me until the way home and after she could n't get them out that I realized that they were the tattoos from radiation ! Gave me a chuckle .

Fotopet , Day , Hang in there , I think we all have difficult days and weeks and it is hard not to let the depression sink in . It seems like an eternity since all this started and I am only 2 down , 14 more to go , plus radiation ... I live alone but my significant other comes every two weeks and stays through my chemo . He lives 110 miles away and has a house , yard and etc to care for . So being alone is tough .

5,1,"Hi Minxie . I think we can all understand where you are coming from and , at least for me , it depends on the day if I feel this way or not . I can tell you that I have gone through counseling almost since the time I was diagnosed and it does help to make an appointment when I feel the worries and the anger creep in . Post traumatic stress is real and it is so difficult to deal with when active treatment ends especially if you are triple neg . I am sure the posters on the triple neg forum will have lots of love to give you on that . I just wanted you to know that check ups are not `` all or nothing '' and you can find that happy medium between you and your onc . My onc is young and great and told me that he does not do tumor markers at all . He said if I insist he will do them but does not feel that they are reliable enough for all of the anxiety they produce . I am good with that but I am probably going to insist on a scan here or there but that is just me . It sounds like a lot of your medical decisions had to be changed quickly without you really getting a a chance to get your mind around them and be comfortable . My big surprise came when they found invasive cancer in the other breast as well but I had already decided that I wanted a BMX so other than feeling like I was on a speeding , out of control cancer train it did not change my treatment decisions . I had already made peace with the surgery and it sounds like you never got that chance . I am sorry for all that you have been through and I just have to believe that better days are ahead . Wonderful days with your kids where cancer was just a blip on your life radar . We are all freaked out and scared and if you want to close the door on it no one would blame you but try to breathe and give it day by day . You may find that each time you get the `` all clear ' you stop fearing the labcoats more and more . These forums have been great support to me and sometimes I just come and `` lurk '' and read and feel better or learn something . I do n't always have the urge to post but I always learn .

Atypia is when they start to have irregular cell shapes and nuclei . Atypia is thought to be one of the early stages of going down the road to being a cancer . If you had atypia , they might want to monitor you more closely . r/o means rule out . In the future tense , this means they have yet to rule out a fibroadenoma or breast cancer .

Still it was a shock to learn that I 'd need chemo and Herceptin - I thought by going the radical route of mastectomy I could avoid chemo . I agree with the other women who have advised you to seek out the genetic testing . If you end up BRCA1 or 2 positive , then it may give you more confidence moving ahead with a bi-lat and recon . However , if you 're negative - and you 're Her2 - , you may wish to take a less radical approach and go for the lumpectomy and rads .

I have not had any additional treatment besides my excisional biopsy last July which got all of the DCIS out . At follow up appt . a week after the biopsy , a medical oncologist spoke with me and told me that my tumor was sooo tiny he thought there was a miniscule chance it would cause me problems down the road and he did not recommend radiation therapy or hormonal therapy with their associated risks and side effects for my particular situation . He actually told me I was not to lose sleep over this or worry about it and he never expected to see me again . I also met with a radiation oncologist who wavered a bit on his recommendation , -LRB- seems like you , I was sort of in a ` gray ' area on rad treatments -RRB- but ultimately told me after we had a long discussion that he says I get a pass on this and that with my particular circumstances that if I were his wife , he would NOT treat me with radiation .

I can only imagine what false sense of security women will have now that they are trying to push it up 10 more years . All this panel needs to do is come on here and read how many 40 'S and younger are battling BC . Most of us had to find the lump ourselves because I can not tell you how long it had been since I had a gynecologist do a breast exam on me at my yearly screening . Are we just to sit quietly and let younger women who may have a more aggressive cancer die because these screenings do n't save ENOUGH lives ? That seems to be what the panel is saying ... there are not enough added lives saved by doing these exams in the 40 's . Well , as we all know , the pain of that one more life lost because of a young mother , wife , daughter , friend dying of BC is immense and felt by many . Crazy .

So , does that mean that , before menopause , you are more likely to get estrogen dependent bc -LRB- and the percentage will be higher -RRB- and that afterwards , with the estrogen levels having fallen , if you get bc , the rate of estrogen-dependent bc will be less and if it is estrogen dependent , the % will be lower ? I was dx last year with DCIS -LRB- medium & high grade , multicentric -RRB- shortly after my 50th birthday when I was still having regular periods . Since then I have had eratic periods and have only had one light one in 8 months . A blood test last week confirmed that I am menopausal . My bc was 84 % for estrogen . Does that mean that , now that I have less estrogen in my body , there is less chance of getting a new primary bc in my remaining breast ? I hope this all makes sense !

0,1,"I am diagnosed with PTSD and a panic disorder from childhood abuse . i was very stable on meds for about a decade until after I had my first chemo . I had a terrible reaction to the Taxotere , but I donot think that is all that was involved . After chemo , I was put on prednisone which sends me into orbit and into panic attacks . But even off of the steroid , I found I was having unusual panic for me at my stage of recovery in mental health . I have been sober over 21 years -LRB- not a brag -RRB- and after the first chemo , I felt as though I was ` brain damaged . '' I only know the feeling because I had a lot of panic -LRB- like thru the roof -RRB- in early sobriety . My brain simply couldnot function , nor could it after the chemo . I had very little impulse control and too much fatigue to deal with anything . I found all of my emotions to be extremely raw and the anxiety was awful . For me , the chemo and its effects , triggered old feelings and emotions and I could notmuster the emotional , physical or spiritual resources to contend with the post chemo brain trauma . I had to switch anti-anxiety meds from klonopin to lorazepam . Therapy was of no use to me if I could not function well enough to get to my therapist . i had to wait until I was a little more stable on the new medications tobegin to work on the PTSD again -LRB- PTSD for me flairs up under stress and cancer is the most stressful event I can think of -RRB- . I thought I would be able tojumpright backintomy daily activities after the chemo becasue that is what the doctor toldme would happen . Boy was he ever wrong . And six weeks after the first chemo , he continues to be wrong . I have to keep my day very simple ; I have to set time aside for rest ; I have to have proper nutrition -LRB- caffiene and sugar is a no-no for me -RRB- and ; I am having to use all of the tools I used in early sobriety to try and ` stabilize ' myself at a bio/psycho/social level . In short , no intense events going on for me -LRB- in a perfect world -RRB- . And I truly have to vent a lot either here on the Board or with trusted friends who have been thru cancer and are further down the road than I am . Lastly , I had to learn how to breathe again and push myself to do daily exercise -LRB- like a walk to the mail box on some days-best I can do -RRB- . I also curb my activities and try not to set myself up for failure . I do not know how women go back to work right after chemo . Grocery shopping may be allI can do one day with laundry the next . My house still looks like a dumpster with windows on it . Today is the first day I manage to clean the house a bit but I am paying for it in very sore muscles tonight . The one thing I am not doing well is getting enough sleep-because I am posting on the Board at 2 AM or something like that-errrgh . Good luck my dear , SV ",road,and are further down the road than I am . Lastly,1

Now that the incisions have healed I wear anything that is n't too tight ... still no bra .

0,1,"Thank you so much for posting this !! I was just dx with stage 4 type 2 w/mets to bone on 12/24/09 . I have been struggling with the when and how to tell my family all the while undergoing all sorts tests and second opinions for the past several weeks . I 'm thoroughly exhausted . I lost my husband 6 years ago when my kids were 16 -LRB- son -RRB- & 18 -LRB- daughter -RRB- . My daughter had just started college and consequently dropped out . She 's floundered around for a couple years . She had a good job and I thought `` on the road '' when she was recently laid off . I 'm sure she needs to see someone for depression but who can afford it , especially without insurance . I know this will send her into a spiral but I also know that she needs to be told . She will be devistated when I tell her and will be just as devistated if I do n't . I 'm also worried about my son , but really do n't know how he will react .

Initially I felt a little off , but nothing worse then feeling light headed . Then I had hot flashes , which were not bad since I live in a cold climate and I 'm always cold . I 'm 47 , premenopausal , and I thought I would go into full on menopause , but so far everything is `` ok '' . Although I do feel like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and might one day wake up to an entirely different reality . Anxiously awaiting any results from Tailorx which might shed some light on those of us who chose to take Tamoxifen only - no chemo . My Oncologist recently prescribed 50,000 iu 's of Vitamin D , taken once a week . Wow - after the first dose , I felt like I could jump over tall buildings in a single bound . Now , after my 3rd dose , I just feel like myself again before bc . F *** ckg cancer . I still hate that I did everything right : no family history , non smoker , above average condition for my age , almost vegetarian diet and I still got cancer . It was so far from my radar , that I never even for a moment considered it would ever happen to me . ",light,but nothing worse then feeling light headed . Then I had,1
4,1,"Robyn-Sorry you find yourself on this web site but I am happy you found it . I was 45 with 5 and 7 year old boys when I was dx in 2006 . I am still here to type this . I know you are scared and it feels like someone just put a bomb off in your head but until you get your test results you will probably feel this way . It is like a roller coaster ride at first . Once you have your results the planning stages will start . Hopefully it is not cancer and life will get back to normal soon . If it turns out to bc it sounds like they will have caught it pretty early . Do n't read to much about it yet . You can scare yourself even more . Come back here for support though . It is a wonderful place and there are so many wise , loving women here to help . ",ride,is like a roller coaster ride at first . Once you,1
